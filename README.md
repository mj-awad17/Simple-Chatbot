## Overview

Welcome to the **Simple Chatbot** project! This is a Python-based application that leverages the Streamlit library to create an interactive web-based chatbot interface. The chatbot is designed to facilitate user interaction in a simple and intuitive manner.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can engage in a chat session with the bot via a user-friendly web interface.
<!-- - **Real-time Responses**: The chatbot responds to user inputs in real-time. -->
- **Efficient Backend**: The application is built using Streamlit for a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the application.
- **Streamlit**: A powerful library for creating interactive web applications quickly and easily.
- **Gemini API**: A crucial component for processing and generating chatbot responses. Note that the details of the Gemini API are managed and hidden for security and privacy reasons.
